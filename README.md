It looks like you have a Python script that retrieves data from an SQLite database and then uses the Plotly library to create a plot of close prices for a specific expiry date. If you want to provide documentation for your script, you can create a `README.md` file to explain how to use the script and any other relevant information. Here's an example of what your `README.md` file might look like:

```markdown
# Option Price Visualization

This Python script retrieves option price data from an SQLite database and creates a Plotly graph to visualize close prices for a specific expiry date.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly
- sqlite3

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/option-price-visualization.git
cd option-price-visualization
```

2. Ensure your SQLite database file (`option_history.db`) is in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

4. The script will output information about the data in the database, including the total number of keys and details for each key.

5. After processing the data, the script will generate a Plotly graph showing close prices for a specified expiry date (`19-JAN-2023` in this example).

## Additional Information

- The script uses the `get_from_database` function to retrieve data from the SQLite database.
- The Plotly library is employed to create an interactive line plot of close prices for the specified expiry date.
- The x-axis is assumed to be categorical (date) data.

Feel free to customize the script to fit your specific needs or modify the `expiry_date_to_plot` variable to visualize data for a different expiry date.

Remember to replace "yourusername" and "your_script_name.py" with your actual GitHub username and the name of your Python script. Additionally, you can provide more details or instructions based on your specific requirements.
